## Overview

This is a **modern web application** in development, integrating **Laravel 10** as the backend framework, with **Three.js** and **Yuka.js** for 3D graphics and AI behaviors. The frontend leverages **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Notion API** to manage and fetch content dynamically from Notion databases.

The goal is to create a responsive and interactive experience combining cutting-edge web technologies and a clean, efficient workflow.

## Features

- **Backend with Laravel 10**: Secure and scalable PHP framework for rapid development.
- **Three.js Integration**: 3D rendering engine to create interactive 3D visualizations.
- **Yuka.js**: AI library for simulating autonomous behaviors and decision-making in virtual environments.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for flexible, responsive design.
- **Notion API**: Content fetched directly from Notion databases for dynamic and real-time content updates.
